                   <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <h3>The Now</h3>
                        <p>I am currently enrolled at a 14-week programming bootcamp called We Can Code IT in Columbus, Ohio. Along with a moderate sized cohort, I've been tackling "real-world" projects in an agile environment using paired and mob programming. Sprints range 1-3 weeks.</p>
                        
                    <h3>Background</h3>
                        <p>Working service-industry jobs have been a large part of my adult life. As a bartender for the last 8 years, I have benefited from meeting many (many) kinds of interesting people. I hold extreme value to crafting the best product and entertaining guests in the most creative ways that I can.</p>
                        
                        <p>It wasn't until I started taking on more responsibilities behind the scenes that I considered an exact path towards a career change. After I'd adopted the task of counting the bar inventory and managed a database, my interest had peaked. I wanted to know more.</p>
                        
                        <p>This lead to independent studies including coding-practice websites, lecure videos, reading sources, and plenty of subreddit crawling. Joining We Can Code IT has vastly honed my skills as a coder.</p>
                        
                        <p>I'm ready to craft new kinds of products.</p>
