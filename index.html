        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <h3>The Now</h3>
        <p>I am currently enrolled at a 14-week programming bootcamp called We Can Code IT in Columbus, Ohio. Along with a moderate
            sized cohort, I've been tackling "real-world" projects in an agile environment using paired and mob programming. Sprints range 1-3 weeks.
        </p>
        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p> Working service-industry jobs have been a large part of my adult life. As a bartender for the last 8 years, I have 
            benefited from meeting many (many) kinds of interesting people. I hold extreme value to crafting the best product and entertaining guests in the most creative ways
            that I can. 
        </p>    
        <p> It wasn't until I started taking on more responsibilities behind the scenes
            that I considered an exact path towards a career change. After I'd adopted the task of counting the bar inventory and managed
            a database, my interest had peaked. I wanted to know more. 
        </p>
        <p> This lead to independent studies including coding-practice websites, lecure videos, reading sources, and plenty of subreddit crawling. Joining We Can Code IT has 
            vastly honed my skills as a coder.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm ready to craft new kinds of products.
        </p>
