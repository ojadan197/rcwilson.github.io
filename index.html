        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <h3>The Now</h3>
        <p>I am currently enrolled at a 14-week programming bootcamp called We Can Code IT in Columbus, Ohio. Along with a moderate
            sized cohort, I've been tackling "real-world" projects in an agile environment using paired and mob programming.
        </p>
        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>Working service-industry jobs have been a large part of my adult life. As a bartender for the last 8 years, I have 
            benefited from meeting many, many kinds of interesting people. Creating my own product for the guests and entertaining
            any creative way I can is something that I hold extreme value to. It wasn't until I started taking on more responsibilities
            that I considered an exact path of a career change. Specificially, when I adopted the task of counting the bar inventory and 
            doing orders and managing a database. I wanted to know more. 
        </p>
        <p>This lead to independent, online coding classes and doing as much research as I had time for to get 
            into this field. 
        </p>
