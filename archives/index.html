                        <p>I am currently enrolled at We Can Code IT, a 14-week intense software development training
                            bootcamp in Columbus, Ohio. Along with a moderate sized cohort, I've been tackling
                            "real-world" projects in an agile environment using paired and mob programming. Sprints
                            range 1-3 weeks.</p>

                    <div class="main__about-me-grid__summary">
                        <p>Working service-industry jobs have been a large part of my adult life. As a bartender for the
                            last 8 years, I have benefited from meeting many (many) kinds of interesting people. I hold
                            extreme value to crafting the best product and entertaining guests in the most creative ways
                            that I can.</p>

                        <p>It wasn't until I started taking on more responsibilities behind the scenes that I considered
                            an exact path towards a career change. After I'd adopted the task of counting the bar
                            inventory and managed a database, my interest had peaked. I wanted to know more.</p>

                        <p>This lead to independent studies including coding-practice websites, lecure videos, reading
                            sources, and plenty of subreddit crawling. Joining We Can Code IT has vastly honed my skills
                            as a coder.</p>

                        <p>I'm ready to craft new kinds of products.</p>

                        Tasked with creating a virtual pet shelter game. The game begins by generating random projects
                        in
                        in the shelter for the user. User checks up and maintains pets' health, thirst, happiness, and
                        more. The game
                        featuers a "tick" method to give the player a "real-time" experience.
